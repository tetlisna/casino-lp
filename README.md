# Casino Landing Page

Welcome to the Casino Landing Page project! This project is designed to provide an engaging and interactive landing page for a casino, built with Next.js and deployed using GitHub Pages.

## ðŸŒŸ Why This Project Stands Out

- **Interactive Elements**: All buttons, menu items, and forms are fully functional.
- **Smooth Navigation**: Links in the top and bottom menus lead to the appropriate sections on the page with smooth scrolling effects.
- **Responsive Design**: The page is fully responsive and looks great on all devices without any horizontal scrolling.
- **User Feedback**: Includes hover styles, smooth animations, and clear form placeholders with validation instructions.
- **Performance**: The page loads quickly, providing a smooth user experience.

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
- **Sass**: For efficient and modular CSS.
- **HTML5**: For the page structure.
- **TypeScript**: For typing JS.
- **Api**: [`Free to game API`]( https://www.freetogame.com/api/games);
